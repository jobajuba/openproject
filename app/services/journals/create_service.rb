# Will create journals for a journable (e.g. WorkPackage and Meeting)
# As a journal is basically a copy of the current state of the database, consisting of the journable as well as its
# custom values and attachments, those entries are copied in the database.
# Copying and thereby creation only takes place if a change of the current state and the last journal is identified.
# Note, that the adequate creation of a journal which represents the state that is generated by a single user action depends on
# no other user/action altering the current state at the same time especially in a multi process/thread setup.
# Therefore, the whole update of a journable needs to be safeguarded by a mutex. In our implementation, we use
#
# OpenProject::Mutex.with_advisory_lock_transaction(journable)
#
# for this purpose.

    # The sql necessary for creating the journal inside the database.
    # It consists of a couple of parts that are kept as individual queries (as CTEs) but
    # are all executed within a single database call.
    #
    # The first CTEs (`max_journals`) responsibility is to fetch the latests journal and have that available for later queries
    # (i.e. when determining the latest state of the journable and when getting the current version number).
    #
    # The second CTE (`changes`) determines whether a change as occurred so that a new journal needs to be created. The next CTE,
    # that will insert new data, will only do so if the changes CTE returns an entry. The only exception to this check is that
    # if a note is provided, a journal will be created regardless of whether any changes are detected. To determine whether a
    # change is worthy of being journalized, the current and the latest journalized state are compared in three aspects:
    # * the journable's table columns are compared to the columns in the journable's journal data table
    # (e.g. work_package_journals for WorkPackages). Only columns that exist in the journable's journal data table are considered
    # (and some columns like the primary key `id` is ignored). Therefore, to add an attribute to be journalized, it needs to
    # be added to that table.
    # * the journable's attachments are compared to the attachable_journals entries being associated with the most recent journal.
    # * the journable's custom values are compared to the customizable_journals entries being associated with the most
    # recent journal.
    # When comparing text based values, newlines are normalized as otherwise users having a different OS might change a text value
    # without intending to.
    #
    # Only if a change has been identified (or if a note is present) is a journal inserted by the third CTE (`insert_journal`).
    # Its creation timestamp will be updated_at value of the journable as this is the logical creation time. If a note is present,
    # however, the current time is taken as it signifies an action in itself and there might not be a change at all. In such a
    # case, the journable will later on receive the creation date of the journal as its updated_at value. The update timestamp of
    # a journable and the creation date of its most recent journal should always be in sync.
    #
    # Both cases (having a note or a change) can at this point be identified by a journal having been created. Therefore, the
    # return value of that insert statement is further on used to identify whether the next statements (`insert_data`,
    # `insert_attachable` and `insert_customizable`) should actually insert data. It is additionally used as the values returned
    # by the overall SQL statement so that an AR instance can be instantiated with it.
    #
    # If a journal is created, all columns that also exist in the journable's data table are inserted as a new entry into
    # to the data table with a reference to the newly created journal. Again, newlines are normalized.
    #
    # If a journal is created, all entries in the attachments table associated to the journable are recreated as entries
    # in the attachable_journals table.
    #
    # If a journal is created, all entries in the custom_values table associated to the journable are recreated as entries
    # in the customizable_journals table. Again, newlines are normalized.
